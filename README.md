# Project Brief
In this project, we will apply supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census.

We applied data exploration, visualization, data pre-processing, feature extraction and 6 classifiers which is : 
1-RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER
2-BAGGING CLASSIFIER
3-ENSEMBLE ADABOOST CLASSIFIER
4-MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON CLASSIFIER
5-DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER
6-NAÏVE BYES CLASSIFIER

# Project Conclusion 
We found that the highest classifier is the Bagging Using Decision Tree Classifier and the lowest is naïve byes classifier
